	The whole idea of a podcast is something you can listen to while traveling or working without being over challenged intellectually.

Thoughts on Publishing cost :
	   I want to start out with my podcast to be published as guest episodes in other podcasts.
	   Really it is just an entry in the rss feed. It should be easy for someone to clone my repo or an episode.

Exclusivity : someone might want to have exclusive distribution of an episode.

Spectacle :

	    Want to have rich and multidimensonal shownotes that are indexed by timecode so that you can have additional media to play along.

	    Ideally the podcast will be recording not only the screen but the events of the keyboard of a program and be replayible for learning purposes.

	    The timeline will have links to things mentioned along the way.

We want to have a dedicated player for sharing segments of the show with links, and each time section of the show should be clearly tagged somehow.

A transcript will be great as wel as the script or outline of the show. Video and images for each section should be available as well as user annotations.

Now the idea of a user annotation is good because you the user could override a section of the show with your own notes or audio. The enhanced player should be able to preload each clip in order to play it right and a renderer will create audio, video and interactive web presentation streams for each section.

Thing about using prezi or another tool.

The elements are : plot, character, diction, thought, spectacle, and music.

1. Plot, a story that is gripping, has a beginning, middle and end. Problems faced and solved.

2. Character study and

3. Diction is the metric components

4. Thought : new ideas begin presented

3. Music, each show should feature a different artist, ideally creative commons licensed.
